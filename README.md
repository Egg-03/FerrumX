# About
FerrumX is a lightweight Hardware and Network Information wrapper written in pure Java. It contacts some [Computer System Hardware Classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/computer-system-hardware-classes) and [Operating System Classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/operating-system-classes) of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) through PowerShell to fetch comprehensive system details on Windows Operating Systems.

# Supported Operating Systems
FerrumX has been tested to work exclusively on <strong>Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11</strong> devices.
For Windows 7 and Vista support, see: [FerrumL](https://github.com/Egg-03/FerrumL) [not actively developed anymore]

# Installation
<h4>For Developers:</h4>
If you wish to use the wrapper in your own project, you can do so by downloading the main jar file along with it's documentation


- Download the main jar file *[FerrumX-core-vX.X.X]* from [FerrumX Releases](https://github.com/Egg-03/FerrumX/releases)
- [Optional] Download the javadoc jar file *[FerrumX-doc-vX.X.X]*
- Import the main jar file as a classpath dependency in your project.
- [Optional] Attach the javadoc to the jar file

The methods for linking an external jar file with its javadoc as a dependency varies with the IDE you will use. You should be able to find online help for it and if I get time, I'll 
attach the tutorials for Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea
